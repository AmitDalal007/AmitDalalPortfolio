                    <p>As a teenager at school, I was the kid other students approached about issues with their phone or laptop. I was the go-to guy for fixing resolving any technical problems. Today, not much has changed. I’m still the first point of call
                        for technical issues. I’ve always been fascinated by computers and the technical mechanics behind the monitor. My natural curiosity for computers is what drove me towards my computer science degree.

        I am a Amit Dalal.
        I am a front end developer, back end developer and a full stack developer, Amit Dalal. I love coding. I like to learn about new technology. I am quick learner. Coding is my passion. I have experiences with html, css, react, nodejs, reactjs, bootstrap, tailwindcss, google firebase, mongodb, fastapi, jwt authentication, materialui, responsive design, Axios requests, fetch api data. Portfolio A computer Santra, sometimes called more recently a coder (especially in more
        informal contexts), is a person who creates computer software. The term computer santra can refer to a specialist in one area of computers, or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. A Santra's most oft-used computer language
        (e.g., Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lisp, Python) may be prefixed to the term Santra. Some who work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with web. Amit Dalal A range of occupations that involve programming
        also often require a range of other, similar skills, for example: (software) developer, web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer, software engineer, computer scientist, game Santra, game developer and software
        analyst. The use of the term santra as applied to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or even derogatory. British countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is often considered to be the first computer Santra, as she
        was the first to publish part of a program (specifically an algorithm) intended for implementation on Charles Babbage's analytical engine, in October 1842. The algorithm was used to calculate Bernoulli numbers.[7] Because Babbage's machine was
        never completed as a functioning standard in Lovelace's time, she unfortunately never had the opportunity to see the algorithm in action. The ENIAC programming team, consisting of Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran
        Bilas and Ruth Lichterman were the first regularly working Santras.[8][9] International Santras' Day is celebrated annually on 7 January.[10] In 2009, the government of Russia decreed a professional annual holiday known as Santras' Day to be celebrated
        on 13 September (12 September in leap years). It had already been an unofficial holiday before that in many countries. The word software was used as early as 1953, but did not regularly appear in print until the 1960s.[11] Before this time, computers
        were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer manufacturers of the time, such as UNIVAC and IBM. The first company founded to specifically provide software products and services was the Computer Usage Company, in 1955.[12]
        The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments and businesses created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house
        by full-time staff Santras; some were distributed freely between users of a particular machine for no charge. And others were developed on a commercial basis. Other firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation (founded in 1959) also started to
        grow. The computer/hardware manufacturers soon started bundling operating systems, system software and programming environments with their machines.[citation needed] The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer ("PC") in
        the mid-1970s, which brought computing to the average office worker. In the following years the PC also helped create a constantly-growing market for games, applications and utilities software. CP/M, later replaced by DOS, Microsoft's Windows
        popular operating system of the time.[13] portfolio Amit Dalal In the early years of the 21st century, another successful business model has arisen for hosted software, called software-as-a-service, or SaaS. From the point of view of producers
        of some proprietary software, SaaS reduces the concerns about unauthorized copying, since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition, no client software is loaded onto the end user's PC. SaaS is typically run out of the cloud.
        Computer Santras write, test, debug, and maintain the detailed instructions, called computer programs, that computers must follow to perform their functions. Santras also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer.
        Many technical innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the role of a Santra and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions
        may vary, depending on the organization. Santras work in many settings, including corporate information technology ("IT") departments, big software companies, small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many professional Santras
        also work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is not typically required to work as a Santra, although professional certifications are commonly held by Santras. Programming is widely considered a profession (although
        some[who?] authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession). Santras' work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions
        involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours, more complex ones may require more than
        a year of work, while others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several Santras work together as a team under a senior Santra's supervision. portfolio A software engineer
        writing JavaScript portfolio Amit Dalal Santras write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior Santras and by systems analysts. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the santra to convert
        that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The santra codes these instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the program. COBOL,
        for example, is commonly used for business applications that typically run on mainframe and midrange computers, whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering. C++ and Python are widely used for both scientific and business applications. Java,
        C#, JS and PHP are popular programming languages for Web and business applications. Santras generally know more than one programming language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice,
        Santras often are referred to by the language they know, e.g. as Java Santras, or by the type of function they perform or environment in which they work: for example, database Santras, mainframe Santras, or Web developers. When making changes
        to the source code that programs are made up of, Santras need to make other Santras aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by inserting comments in the source code so that others can understand the program more easily and
        by documenting their code. To save work, Santras often use libraries of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases Santras' productivity by
        eliminating some routine steps. Testing and debugging Santras test a program by running it and looking for bugs (errors). As they are identified, the santra usually makes the appropriate corrections, then rechecks the program until an acceptably
        low level and severity of bugs remain. This process is called testing and debugging. These are important parts of every Santra's job. Santras may continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a program. Updating, repairing, modifying,
        and expanding existing programs is sometimes called maintenance programming. Santras may contribute to user guides and online help, or they may work with technical writers to do such work. Application versus system programming Computer Santras
        often are grouped into two broad types: application Santras and systems Santras. Application Santras write programs to handle a specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an organization. They also may revise existing packaged software
        or customize generic applications which are frequently purchased from independent software vendors. Systems Santras, in contrast, write programs to maintain and control computer systems software, such as operating systems and database management
        systems. These workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and CPU of the system handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as printers and disk
        drives. Amit Dalal Types of software portfolio Santras in software development companies may work directly with experts from various fields to create software – either programs designed for specific clients or packaged software for general
        use – ranging from video games to educational software to programs for desktop publishing and financial planning. Programming of packaged software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer services industry. Some companies
        or organizations – even small ones – have set up their own IT team to ensure the design and development of in-house software to answer to very specific needs from their internal end-users, especially when existing software are not suitable or
        too expensive. This is for example the case in research laboratories.[citation needed] In some organizations, particularly small ones, people commonly known as santra analysts are responsible for both the systems analysis and the actual programming
        work. The transition from a mainframe environment to one that is based primarily on personal computers PCs has blurred the once rigid distinction between the santra and the user. Increasingly, adept end users are taking over many of the tasks
        previously performed by Santras. For example, the growing use of packaged software, such as spreadsheet and database management software packages, allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform calculations.[citation needed]
        Amit Dalal In addition, the rise of the Internet has made web development a huge part of the programming field. Currently more software applications are web applications that can be used by anyone with a web browser.[citation needed] Examples
        of such applications include the Google search service, the Outlook.com e-mail service, and the Flickr photo-sharing service. Amit Dalal Programming editors, also known as source code editors, are text editors that are specifically designed
        for Santras or developers for writing the source code of an application or a program. Most of these editors include features useful for Santras, which may include color syntax highlighting, auto indentation, auto-complete, bracket matching, syntax
        check, and allows plug-ins. These features aid the users during coding, debugging and testing.[17] portfolio Amit Dalal Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming
        can be done using a variety of computer "languages," such as SQL, Java, Python, and C++.
